2021-09-30,$tsla   Top analyst-price target for tomorrow .-
2021-09-30,Neither horse doing well this week $NVDA vs $TSLA
2021-09-30,Once @CathieDWood and @ARKInvest capitulate on $TSLA I'll start to buy.   At some point it starts to make sense.  Jilted ex-bulls making it sound like the company is going to zero.  Obviously not.
2021-09-30,Cyber Camping üìêüèïÔ∏è #Cybertruck $TSLA #TSLA
2021-09-30,‚ÄúIn hindsight we should have sold our entire $TSLA position rather than kept a small % of it.‚Äù \n This kinda makes me want to start accumulating.  I mean I won't because the #CyberTruck was an obvious albatross that will crush the company.  But almost all the bulls are out.
2021-09-30,#Tesla $TSLA could become a "nightmare on Elm Street" if it chooses Robotaxi over Model 2 warns Wedbush analyst and longtime bull Dan Ives.
2021-09-30,$TSLA has reduced the price of its Full Self-Driving Capability software in the U.S. from $12000 to $8000 as displayed on its website. This adjustment follows a $2000 price cut on three of its vehicle models‚ÄîModel Y Model X and Model S.
2021-09-30,The issue with $tsla is no clear strategy to deal with competition the only thing Elon does is cut prices which proved not work. Elon is acting like desperate and he himself lost confidence in the company.
2021-09-30,#Japan's $TSLA expert explained an anecdote about #Model3's early line troubles. "When Elon Musk is in a desperate situation he becomes possessed by a "demon mode."üòà At that point no one will be able to stop him. He is probably in "demon mode" and is causing a time schedule panic due to the discrepancy between the demon's time axis and the human time axis. $TSLA ‚§µÔ∏è #tesla
2021-09-30,This is what I find most strange about the market's patience with $TSLA : they waste their resources on Elon's vanity projects (Roadster Semi CT Optimus) instead of producing more models and entering more segments yet the institutionals don't seem to care.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-09-30,This earnings call will be fire üòÇüòÇüòÇ Anyone shorting $tsla tomorrow? üëÄ
2021-09-30,$TSLA they cut Model S and Y by 20% in China üò≥ Tesla can no longer compete all they have is price cuts left. Red flags are every where.
2021-09-30,There is only one path forward for $TSLA and Elon. Admit FSD is far from ready give customers refunds and low-key continue working on it until it's ready. Refocus efforts on sub-$25K vehicle Semi and Roadster. Full steam ahead on 4680 and Megapack.
2021-09-30,All the $tsla fanboys worry that ‚Äúno ‚Äú will tank the stock price it may in short term but in long term which benefits $tsla more-Elon as a part time ceo or a more capable full time ceo? There are some capable ceos even in car industry/AI world $tsla can move on wo Elon.
2021-09-30,If you can't understand that just go ALL IN on $TSLA no need to start arguments here it's all bright future and BULL SIGNALS are overwhelming get rich yourself and leave us blind self- proclaimed practical investors behind then. No need to feel sorry for us.

2021-09-30,Elon Musk stopped discounting #Tesla #BEV s a few days ago but has cut it again and the full #FSD price in the United States has also been significantly reduced. Of course will $TSLA stock price fall on the #Nasdaq market tomorrow Monday?

2021-09-30,So you are relying on the ‚Äúopinions‚Äù of two people who both have an enormous vested interest in making people believe that $TSLA is undervalued? Not to mention that both have been proven wrong over and over again. And with Elon Musk I'm using the word ‚Äúwrong‚Äù generously.
